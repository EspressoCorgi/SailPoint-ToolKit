# VSCode Snippet

This is a tool I found from idampundit.com that will allow you to easily write Transforms.

---

## Configure the Snippet

To configure a Snippet on VSCode you will need to 

1. Open “Configure User Snippets” in VS Code Preferences
2. Click on “New Global Snippets File”
3. Call it "transforms”
4. In the file opened, replace the entire content with below code snippet
Save and close the file 
5. Now start typing the name of the transform (e.g. firstValid) and it will show up.
6. Press Enter and it will show you the code

## Future Plans
 
I am planning on adding logic to this Snippet that will allow making nested transforms super simplistic and allow little no room for JSON error
